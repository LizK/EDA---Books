# EDA - GOODREADS Project
**Last updated:** 2020-07-09

## Introduction:
Welcome to my GoodReads Exploratory Data Analysis project. In this repo, I will aim at analysing GoodReads datasets as reinforcing the learning after completing an Intro to Python for Data Analytics Course instructed by Ramon Perez - A Data Scientist and Educator at Coder Academy

## Data Analytics Cycle
Data analysis cycle is a workflow of phases a data analyst would employ to organize and manage the tasks associated with analysis of any data set. 
Data analysis cycle is divided into the following stages:
1. Defining the project/problem
2. Obtaining the data
3. Clean the data
4. Manipulate the data and get it ready for analysis
5. Analyse the data
6. Make predictions
7. Report findings
8. Present findings and gather feedback
9. Implement feedback 

### 1. Defining the project

Goodreads is a website that allows users to sign up and register books to generate library catalogs reading lists or interact with other users on the site. Since itâ€™s inception, it continues to see continued growth in users and the number of catalogued books.

Books are an escape to the everyday life and expands my imagination. This is the reason I love reading them and have since from when I was very young. I have a lot of respect for the authors who take time to pen stories of characters that I can relate or meet for the first time and allow me to visit places in my mind.

Am keen to analyse the dataset on ratings, trends of author over years and against all their books if any. It would be interesting to know if there are people who buy books based on the reviews they read. Given we have different types of books based on a wide range of topics, I would not expect the reviews to be the same.

### 2. Obtain Data
Goodreads is the largest site worldwide for readers and book recomendations. The platform offers a space for book lovers to interract and could be a driving force to books bought. It will be intersting to analyse the GoodReads dataset to have an understanding of user's reading habits and possibly see what predictions could be established.

The GoodReads I will be working on was accessed from Kaggle Data.

### 3. Cleaning Data
This is the process of detecting and removing inaccurate or corrupt datasets.

### 4. Manipulate the data and get it ready for analysis 
This is the process of changing datasets to make it easier to be read or better organised.

### 5. Analyse the data
This is the process of transforming and modeling the data with the aim of discovering useful insights and drawing conclusions that could support in decision making.

### 6. Make predictions
This is the process of using the analysed data in making forecast for future events using statistics and machine learning techniques.

### 7. Report findings
This involves Communicating the insights drawn using simple language that can be understood by the stakeholders.

### 8. Present findings and gather feedback
This process ensures that communication was clear and understood by the target audience.

### 9. Implement feedback
There is always room for improvement in data analysis and this is only possible through feedback from the stakeholders.
